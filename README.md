# My Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

## Overview

Welcome to my repository containing solutions for the Advent of Code 2023. This collection of code is primarily for documentation purposes and showcases my journey through the challenges. The main objective is to enhance my skills in Rust, a language known for its efficiency and safety features. Please note that the solutions are not optimized for performance or best practices, but rather serve as a learning tool and a record of my progress.

## Language: Rust

The Advent of Code 2023 solutions are written in Rust. My goal is to become more proficient in Rust by solving these puzzles. If you're also learning Rust, feel free to explore the solutions and share your thoughts or alternative approaches.

## Structure

Each day's challenge has its own directory, named `day-XX`, where `XX` represents the day number. Inside each directory, you will find the Rust source files and maybe a brief README with my thoughts and approach for that day's challenge. Each day also is a git repository.

## Running the Solutions

To run any of the solutions, you will need Rust installed on your system. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory of the day you want to run.
3. Use `cargo run --bin part1/part2` to compile and execute the program.

## Contributions and Feedback

While the primary purpose of this repository is personal documentation, I am open to feedback and suggestions. If you have any insights or alternative methods to solve the puzzles, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are not intended to be the best or most efficient. They are a reflection of my learning process with Rust and the Advent of Code 2023 challenges.
